# Detection-of-texts-from-photos-and-their-translations
I've started this project because of the general need for extracting text from sources, such as (images, books,pamphlets, etc).
As I find more time in my daily life, I will try to improve this program’s capability for future needs and update the program. I’m also planning to implement neural networks to enhance the capabilities of this program.
